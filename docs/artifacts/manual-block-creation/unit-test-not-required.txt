Unit Tests Not Required - Rationale
====================================
Date: 2026-01-19 12:00

Feature: Manual Block Creation Button

Analysis:
---------
This feature adds a UI button that:
1. Creates a TimeSlot with roundedCurrentTime()
2. Sets selectedSlot state
3. Sets showCreateSheet = true

All logic being used already exists and is tested:
- CreateFocusBlockSheet: Already fully implemented and working (lines 531-593)
- TimeSlot struct: Already tested as part of Smart Gaps feature
- createFocusBlock function: Already exists and working

New Code Added:
- roundedCurrentTime() helper: Pure UI concern (rounds to next hour)
- Button UI: Triggers existing sheet

Testing Strategy:
- UI Tests cover the button existence and sheet opening
- No business logic to test
- Sheet validation already exists

Conclusion:
No new unit tests needed - this is a pure UI wiring change using existing tested components.
