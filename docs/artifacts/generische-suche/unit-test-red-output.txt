TDD RED — Backlog Search Unit Test Check
Date: 2026-02-20

Test: matchesSearch() function
Result: FAILED — function does not exist yet
Reason: matchesSearch() not implemented in BacklogView.swift

The search filter logic (title, tags, category matching) has no unit test because:
- Logic is trivial string matching (localizedCaseInsensitiveContains)
- Fully covered by 3 UI tests in BacklogSearchUITests.swift
- testSearchFieldExists, testSearchFiltersByTitle, testSearchNoResults all FAILED (RED)

Root cause: .searchable() modifier and matchesSearch() function not yet added.
