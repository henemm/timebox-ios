Test: RecurringVisibilityUITests/testRecurringVisibilityFilterActive
Status: FAIL (build failed - recurrenceGroupID not found on LocalTask)

Build Errors:
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:165: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:172: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:187: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:195: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:196: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'
RecurrenceServiceTests.swift:197: error: value of type 'LocalTask' has no member 'recurrenceGroupID'

UI Test Assertion (will fail at runtime once build succeeds):
  "Ticket 1: Recurring tasks should have a series group indicator (recurrenceGroupID)"
  - Element 'recurrenceSeriesGroup' does not exist yet

Testing cancelled because the build failed.
** TEST FAILED **
