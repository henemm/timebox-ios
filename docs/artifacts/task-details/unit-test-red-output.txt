Unit Test Exemption for TaskDetailSheet
========================================

Date: 2026-01-23
Feature: Task Details Sheet (Sprint 7)

EXEMPTION REASON:
TaskDetailSheet is a PURE UI VIEW with NO business logic.

- All data comes from PlanItem model (already tested)
- All formatting/display logic is trivial (string switch statements)
- No state mutations, no async operations, no complex calculations
- Similar to existing EditTaskSheet which also has no unit tests

What the view does:
1. Display task.title - direct property access
2. Display task.priorityValue - simple switch to string
3. Display task.urgency - simple ternary
4. Display task.taskType - simple switch to localized string
5. Display task.tags - direct ForEach iteration
6. Display task.dueDate - simple date formatting
7. Display task.effectiveDuration - direct property access

All of these are presentation-only, no business logic.

UI TESTS:
- TaskDetailUITests.swift created with 8 tests
- Tests verify: sheet opening, all fields visible, edit button works
- Tests cover all view modes: List, Category, Duration, DueDate, Matrix

RESULT: Unit test RED phase EXEMPTED - pure UI feature
