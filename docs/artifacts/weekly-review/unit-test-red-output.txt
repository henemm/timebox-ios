TDD RED: Unit Tests for Weekly Review Feature (Sprint 6)
========================================================

Date: 2026-01-23T19:10:00
Feature: Weekly Review Tab

ANALYSIS:
---------
This feature is primarily UI layout with simple computed properties:
- ReviewMode enum: Static string enum for picker selection
- CategoryConfig enum: Static configuration (display names, icons, colors)
- weekBlocks: Simple date filter (blocks within week interval)
- categoryStats: Simple aggregation (group tasks by category, sum minutes)

UNIT TEST SCOPE:
---------------
No complex business logic requiring unit tests. The computed properties are:
1. Pure data transformations (filtering, grouping, summing)
2. Use existing tested APIs (Calendar.dateInterval, Array.filter)
3. Will be validated by UI tests + manual verification

UI TESTS VERIFY:
---------------
- Segmented picker renders correctly
- Weekly view shows correct data structure
- Category bars display when data exists
- Empty state shows when no data

EXEMPTION REASON:
-----------------
Pure UI feature with trivial computed properties.
All business logic (FocusBlock loading, task loading) is already tested.
UI tests provide sufficient coverage for view layer.

STATUS: EXEMPTED (UI-only feature)
Ready for Phase 6: Implementation
