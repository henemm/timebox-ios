======================================================

Date: 2026-01-23T19:04:24
Test File: FocusBloxUITests/DailyReviewUITests.swift

TESTS RUN: 3
TESTS FAILED: 3 (as expected for TDD RED)
TESTS PASSED: 0

FAILED TESTS:
-------------

1. testSegmentedPickerExists()
   - FAILED: Segmented picker does not exist
   - Expected: "Heute" and "Diese Woche" buttons in picker
   - Error: "Diese Woche" button not found within 3 seconds

2. testWeeklyViewShown()
   - FAILED: Weekly view not displayed
   - Expected: Week date range header or weekly empty state
   - Error: "Diese Woche" button not found - cannot tap to switch view

3. testWeeklyEmptyState()
   - FAILED: Weekly empty state not shown
   - Expected: "Diese Woche noch keine Focus Blocks" or content with date range
   - Error: "Diese Woche" button not found - cannot switch to weekly view

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
DailyReviewView does not yet have:
- ReviewMode enum
- Segmented Picker component
- Weekly blocks computed property
- Weekly content view

TDD RED VERIFIED: All tests fail because feature doesn't exist yet.
Ready for Phase 6: Implementation (TDD GREEN)
