BEFORE Screenshot Status - Mock EventKit Phase 2
=================================================

Date: 2026-01-16
File: BlockPlanningView.swift

CANNOT CAPTURE ACTUAL SCREENSHOTS:
The app crashes in iOS Simulator when accessing EventKit without 
device permissions. This is THE BUG we're fixing in Phase 2.

Current State:
- BlockPlanningView instantiates EventKitRepository directly
- Simulator has no EventKit permissions
- App hangs/crashes after 60s wait
- UI tests fail: "Application com.henning.timebox is not running"

This documentation serves as the BEFORE artifact.
AFTER screenshots will be captured once Mock injection is working.
