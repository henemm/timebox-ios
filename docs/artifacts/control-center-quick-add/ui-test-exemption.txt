UI TEST EXEMPTION - Control Center Widget Prototype
====================================================
Date: 2026-01-20

REASON FOR EXEMPTION:
Control Center widgets are System UI - they cannot be tested via XCTest.
- XCUIApplication cannot access Control Center
- iOS Simulator does not support Control Center widgets
- Only real device testing is possible

ALTERNATIVE VERIFICATION:
- Build test (fails before implementation)
- Manual device testing required for this prototype

This is a PROTOTYPE to verify Gemini's claim about requestValueDialog.
