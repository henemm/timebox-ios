TDD Artifact: Step 1 Foundation - Initial Project Setup
=======================================================

Phase: Greenfield Project Setup (no existing code)

Expected Test: Manual verification after implementation
- App compiles successfully
- Console output shows PlanItems list
- Reminders are fetched from Apple EventKit

Current State: RED (code not yet written)
- TaskMetadata: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- PlanItem: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- EventKitRepository: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- SyncEngine: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ContentView: NOT IMPLEMENTED

Test Plan:
1. Build project with xcodebuild
2. Run on simulator
3. Grant reminder permissions
4. Verify console output shows PlanItems

This artifact documents the expected failing state before implementation.
