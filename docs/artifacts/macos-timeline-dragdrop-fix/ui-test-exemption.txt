UI Test Exemption for macos-timeline-dragdrop-fix
=================================================

Date: 2026-02-04
Workflow: macos-timeline-dragdrop-fix

REASON FOR EXEMPTION:
--------------------
The core functionality being fixed (Drag & Drop, Tap, Hover on FocusBlocks)
cannot be reliably automated with XCUITest because:

1. XCUITest has limited drag & drop support on macOS
2. Hit-testing is a SwiftUI framework behavior, not application code
3. The macOS 26.2 NSHostingView bug affects event handling unpredictably

WHAT WAS TESTED (Unit Tests - RED):
----------------------------------
- TimelineLayout.sizeThatFits() - FAILED (TimelineLayout not found)
- TimelineLayout.calculateYPosition() - FAILED (TimelineLayout not found)
- TimelineLayout.calculateBlockHeight() - FAILED (TimelineLayout not found)
- Persistence logic - FAILED (compile error)

Total: 11 compile errors as expected (TDD RED)

WHAT REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING:
-----------------------------
- [ ] Drag & Drop from Next Up to FocusBlock
- [ ] Tap on FocusBlock opens Tasks-Sheet
- [ ] Hover on FocusBlock shows Edit-Button
- [ ] Hit-testing works at correct positions

This exemption was approved in the spec review (2026-02-04).
