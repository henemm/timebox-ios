================================

Test Strategy for Pure UI Changes:

1. Icon Consistency Test - WILL PASS (no UI change needed)
   - Button functionality already tested in TaskAssignmentUITests
   - Icon change is visual only, no testable behavior change

2. Focus Block Delete Test - WILL FAIL (RED)
   - Swipe action not implemented yet
   - Test: Swipe left on block -> Delete button appears
   - Current state: No swipe action exists

3. Drag&Drop Reorder Test - WILL FAIL (RED)
   - Drag handles not visible yet
   - Test: Drag task up/down in block -> Order changes
   - Current state: Uses chevron buttons instead

4. Edit Focus Block Sheet Test - WILL FAIL (RED)
   - Edit sheet not implemented yet
   - Test: Tap on block -> Sheet opens with time pickers
   - Current state: No tap action

5. Edit Task Sheet Test - WILL FAIL (RED)
