FAILURE REASON: ReviewStatsCalculator does not exist in codebase.
Tests reference ReviewStatsCalculator which has zero matches in production code.
Only reference: FocusBloxTests/ReviewEventIntegrationTests.swift

Build would fail with:
  error: cannot find 'ReviewStatsCalculator' in scope

Tests that WILL FAIL:
  - testReviewStatsCalculatorExists: ReviewStatsCalculator type missing
  - testCategoryStatsIncludesCalendarEvents: ReviewStatsCalculator type missing
  - testCategoryStatsExcludesUncategorizedEvents: ReviewStatsCalculator type missing
  - testCategoryStatsExcludesFocusBlockEvents: ReviewStatsCalculator type missing
  - testCategoryStatsCombinesTasksAndEvents: ReviewStatsCalculator type missing

NOTE: Full build also blocked by pre-existing error in QuickEditPickerTests.swift
(CategoryPickerOption not found - unrelated to this feature)
