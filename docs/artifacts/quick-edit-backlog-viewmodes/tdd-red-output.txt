================================

Date: 2026-01-28 17:12:51
Test Suite: QuickEditBacklogUITests (View Mode Callback Bug)

RESULTS:
--------
✗ testCategoryBadgeTapWorksInCategoryViewMode - FAILED (28.489 seconds)
  Reason: CategoryPicker should open after tapping category badge in Category view mode
  Root Cause: onCategoryTap callback not passed to BacklogRow in categoryView

✗ testContextMenuEditWorksInDurationViewMode - FAILED (28.328 seconds)
  Reason: TaskFormSheet should open from context menu in Duration view mode
  Root Cause: onEditTap callback not passed to BacklogRow in durationView

✓ testImportanceBadgeTapWorksInTbdViewMode - PASSED (22.331 seconds)
  Note: XCTSkip - No TBD tasks available in test environment

BUG CONFIRMED:
--------------
In BacklogView.swift, the following view modes do NOT pass QuickEdit callbacks
(onImportanceTap, onCategoryTap, onEditTap, onDeleteTap) to BacklogRow:

1. categoryView (line 486-500)
2. durationView (line 508-523)
3. dueDateView (line 530-545)
4. tbdView (line 552-567)
5. QuadrantCard (line 631-636)

Only listView correctly passes all callbacks.

** TEST FAILED ** - 2/3 tests failed as expected
