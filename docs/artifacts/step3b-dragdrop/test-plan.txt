TDD Artifact: Step 3b Drag & Drop
=================================

Test Plan:
1. MiniBacklogView shows unscheduled tasks horizontally
2. Tasks are draggable from MiniBacklogView
3. Timeline accepts drops
4. Dropping creates calendar event
5. Task marked as scheduled after drop

Current State: RED - Test failed: Drag & Drop NOT IMPLEMENTED
- MiniBacklogView: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- PlanItemTransfer: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Drop handling: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Calendar event creation: NOT IMPLEMENTED

Expected behavior after implementation:
- Drag task from bottom bar to timeline
- Drop creates new calendar event at drop position
- Visual feedback during drag
