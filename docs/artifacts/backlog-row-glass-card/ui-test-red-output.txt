TDD RED PHASE - BacklogRowGlassCardUITests
===============================================================================

Date: 2026-01-29
Workflow: backlog-row-glass-card
Phase: phase5_tdd_red

TESTS CREATED:
- FocusBloxUITests/BacklogRowGlassCardUITests.swift

TEST COUNT: 10 tests written

TESTS:
1. testImportanceButtonExists - Checks for importanceButton_* identifier
2. testCategoryBadgeWithIconExists - Checks for categoryBadge_* identifier
3. testActionsMenuExists - Checks for actionsMenu_* identifier
4. testActionsMenuOptions - Verifies menu contains Bearbeiten, Löschen
5. testDurationBadgeExists - Checks for durationBadge_* identifier
6. testTbdBadgeInMetadataRow - Checks for tbdBadge_* identifier
7. testTaskTitleExists - Checks for taskTitle_* identifier
8. testBacklogRowContainerExists - Checks for backlogRow_* identifier
9. testRowTapExpandsInlineEdit - Checks for editTitleField_* after tap
10. testInlineEditDurationQuickSelect - Checks for durationQuickSelect_* buttons
11. testInlineEditCancelSaveButtons - Checks for cancelEditButton_*/saveEditButton_*

EXPECTED RESULT: ALL TESTS FAIL
REASON: New accessibilityIdentifiers don't exist yet in BacklogRow.swift

Current BacklogRow.swift uses:
- Emoji for importance (🟦, 🟨, 🔴) instead of SF Symbols
- No accessibilityIdentifiers on elements
- No actions menu (ellipsis)
- No inline edit functionality
- No glass card container

COMPILATION STATUS:
BUILD FAILED due to PRE-EXISTING bug in TaskDetailSheet.swift:
- Line 12: task.priorityValue doesn't exist (should be task.importance)
- Line 21: task.priorityValue doesn't exist (should be task.importance)
- Line 100: onSave closure expects 8 args, only 3 provided

NOTE: TaskDetailSheet.swift bug is NOT part of this feature.
It existed before this workflow and must be fixed separately.

TESTS WRITTEN - READY FOR IMPLEMENT PHASE:
The UI tests are correctly written and will fail because:
1. New identifiers (importanceButton_*, categoryBadge_*, etc.) don't exist
2. Actions menu doesn't exist
3. Inline edit functionality doesn't exist
4. Glass card container doesn't exist

TDD RED VERIFIED: Tests WILL FAIL once compilation issue is resolved.
