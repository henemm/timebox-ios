TDD RED Phase - Bug 6: isNextUp restore beim Entfernen
======================================================
Date: 2026-01-18

BUG VERIFICATION (Manual Test)
------------------------------

Test Steps:
1. Open Backlog tab
2. Add task to Next Up (tap arrow-up button)
3. Switch to "Zuordnen" tab
4. Drag task from Next Up into Focus Block
5. Tap X button to remove task from Focus Block

Expected Result:
- Task should reappear in "Next Up" section

Actual Result (FAILED):
- Task disappears completely
- Task is NOT in Focus Block
- Task is NOT in Next Up section
- Task is "lost" (only visible in Backlog if !isNextUp filter is removed)

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
----------------------
File: TimeBox/Sources/Views/TaskAssignmentView.swift
Function: removeTaskFromBlock() (lines 195-213)

The function removes the task from the block's taskIDs but does NOT
restore isNextUp = true. Compare with assignTaskToBlock() which correctly
sets isNextUp = false on assignment.

Missing code in removeTaskFromBlock():
  try syncEngine.updateNextUp(itemID: taskID, isNextUp: true)

TEST RESULT: FAILED (as expected - functionality not implemented)
