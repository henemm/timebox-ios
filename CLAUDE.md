# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Workflow

This project uses the **OpenSpec 4-Phase Workflow**:

| Phase | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `/analyse` | Understand request, research codebase |
| 2 | `/write-spec` | Create specification |
| 3 | User: "approved" | Spec approval |
| 4 | `/implement` | Implement according to spec |
| 5 | `/validate` | Validate before commit |

**Hooks enforce this workflow!** Edit/Write on protected files is blocked unless the workflow is followed.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Slash commands
/analyse      # Start analysis phase
/write-spec   # Create specification
/implement    # Implement (after approval)
/validate     # Validate implementation
```

## Specs

All entities/components need specs before implementation:
- Template: `docs/specs/_template.md`
- Location: `docs/specs/[category]/[entity].md`

## Documentation Structure

- `docs/specs/` - Entity specifications
- `docs/features/` - Feature documentation
- `docs/reference/` - Technical reference
- `docs/project/` - Project management
